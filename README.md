# NeuralSharp
A simple Dotnet Neural Network & Genetic Algorithm library.

## About
I wanted to learn a little bit more about Neural Networks & Genetic Algorithms, so I built this library. It's far from optimal and learns using back propagation & a genetic algorithm. To prove it works I taught it to play Snake, [See it in action here](https://timmoth.github.io/Snake/)
